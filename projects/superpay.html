			<div class="content_text">
                I designed (and helped implement, market, and PM) a patient and provider portal for automated out-of-network claim filing. We reached a point of over 1,000 providers and patients and $250k in transactions, but ultimately pivoted due to struggles with patient sign ups. Learned a lot, cried a little, gained experience to be a better designer and partner in the next project.

        <div class="container_callout content_text block">
            <strong>Goal: </strong>Encourage specialty practice providers (i.e. mental health practitioners, dietitians) to get their out-of-network patients to join SuperPay. The provider doesn’t have to do anything other than tell their patients to sign up – in fact, SuperPay results in less busy-work because now they don’t have to worry about claims. 
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Challenges: </strong>Getting providers to trust us, be hyped about SuperPay, and encourage their patients to sign up because ultimately (after various experiments and campaigns), we found we had to rely on the provider to be the one telling their patients to join SuperPay.

            <strong>Lightweight provider onboarding experience + portal</strong>
            <br/>
            The ideal state is: a provider signs up, links their EHR (which allows us to get their list of patients), enables “auto-invite” which lets us send a message on their behalf to all their current and future out-of-network patients, and then they never have to come back here again. Obviously they’ll want some sort of visibility to who has signed up, etc., so we built a super lightweight portal with general information. I’m happy to say we hit the sweet spot here where providers were happy with having visibility into their patients’ sign-up process but didn’t feel like they had “another thing to do”

                <strong>Challenges: </strong>Convincing people to give us their credit card / bank information - obviously folks will drop off when they reach a payment stage, and SuperPay won’t work unless patients tell us how we can charge them for their visits. <br/> Also, ensuring folks enter their insurance information correctly.

So, we kept the Patient portal lightweight and only showed information you needed to know, with access to detailed information if requested.

            We built the entire SuperPay platform in 2 weeks so that we could get the program up-and-running with our 3 “beta tester” providers. I used Retool to track our onboarding rates, and found the following trend after the first month of SuperPay

            The founders and I figured that <strong>increasing invites sent</strong> was the easiest to tackle, which we did through provider incentives + improved messaging. I also personally wanted to <strong>improve the drop-off rate in the sign-up flow </strong> by making the account creation + payment information as easy as possible, and make us seem as trustworthy as possible since no one wants to put their credit card down on a site that doesn’t feel legit.

                <div class="bullet"><strong>An increase in "Invites Sent" did not  lead to the desired increase in "Sign Ups Started": </strong> In fact, the drop-off rate actually got worse RIP. Before, 78% of the patients who received invites started signing up. And though we did dramatically increase our invites sent and our percentage of patients signed up went up, only 57% of invited patients actually started sign-ups (29 of 51%). No matter what we tried, we just couldn't get patients to start signing up, which ultimately led to the project's demise.   </div>

                We actually found our next (currently-still-alive) project in the middle of all this. While filing out-of-network claims for patients in SuperPay, we found that <strong>each benefits verification call we made took over 30 minutes (working through the insurance company’s automated system, waiting on hold, etc.), and we desperately needed to streamline this process to remain profitable.</strong> With recent developments in AI, we built our own “robodialer” who would call insurance companies and output the benefits information to us. This worked quite marvelously, and we found that practices, billers and RCM companies all needed the same thing, just different scenarios. Thus began the SuperDial journey.
