			The Sustainability Office asked me to help design and brand the 2017 Earth Week, which is a week-long series of events that promote sustainability, such as a social justice dinner, seminar discussions, fresh local food, and 2nd hand clothing pop-up shop. 
			I was given a lot of freedom with this project and ultimately created the logo and posters for the events.

			<b>TAKEAWAYS</b>
			</p>
			<p>
			This project marks the start of my introduction to Illustrator and the glorious pen tool. I had previously used an iPad/Sketchbook and Photoshop to create designs, but I branched out into vector designs here. Looking back, I would definitely change a lot of colors and typography and think more about decluttering the poster (and making everything more readable). But overall, I am very happy with how everything turned out. 
			Another big takeaway from this project is to <b>take on any design challenge</b>, especially when starting out. I was nervous taking on this project because I wasn't sure of my skills, but I'm so thankful I did because 1) lots of progress comes from just doing, and 2) I made many valuable connections through this project that resulted in many other design opportunities down the line.
