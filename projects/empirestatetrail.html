                In August 2023, Shep and I biked the Empire State Trail for a friend's wedding in Canandaigua and it was... a hot mess (of fun!) <br/>
                He was completely out of biking shape (I think he actually did not ride his bike at all the 3 months leading up to the trip) but was totally game for 7 straight days of 100 miles each. It didn't quite work out the way we expected, but we learned a lot about each other and, perhaps more importantly, we made it to the wedding! <br/>

            The Empire State Trail goes North-to-South and East-to-West across the New York State along the Hudson Valley Greenway, Erie Canalway, and Champlain Valley Trail. The most popular route to take is the <strong>Hudson + Erie </strong>(about 560 miles), which is what we did plus a little extra back-and-forth. <br/><br/>

                    There is certainly no need to bike this quickly. I'd recommend ~60 miles a day, but we chose ~100 miles per day because of the wedding deadline, and also because we are cheap and wanted to do the Hudson Valley portion in the first two days since there was no free camping at the time, and there were 2 warmshowers hosts available 100 miles apart.

There's also a significant on-road portion, but it all feels very safe with few cars. We initially planned to stay with a Warmshowers host in Albany, but they ended up being unavailable.

                Use Amtrak to complete your trip! The <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/empire-service-train" class="link" target="_blank">Empire Service</a> and <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/maple-leaf-train" class="link" target="_blank">Maple Leaf</a> both go between Manhattan (Penn Station) and Buffalo and allow carry-on bicycles. They stop at many points along the route which also provides some peace of mind if you need to bail. <br/><br/>
                <img class="summary_image outline" src="../assets/est_mapleleaf.png"/>
                <br/>
                This is a popular trail and it seems like most people have heard that biking <strong>east</strong> (so, not the way we went) on the Erie Canalway is the preferred direction because you're way more likely to have a tailwind the whole way. I kid you not on my way back from Buffalo (when I was biking east), I averaged 17mph whereas I could barely get over 11 on the other days. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This does mean that you will want to <strong>book your Amtrak tickets as soon as you can if you want to bike east</strong> - I met a couple who originally wanted to take the train from Manhattan to Buffalo, and then bike back home, but all the bike tickets were sold out so they had to bike in the other direction.

                I was super happy with our packing setup - it felt as lean as you can get with panniers! A couple tips: 
                <div class="bullet_list">
                    <div class="bullet"><strong>Store your 'must stay dry' gear separately from anything that you may use during the day.</strong> For us, that was our tent, sleeping gear, and clothes. I put my sleeping gear + clothes in 1 waterproof pannier and didn't open that pannier throughout the day. The tent went inside a dry bag. Shep's panniers were not fully waterproof, so his sleeping gear (and sleep clothes) went inside his dry bag.</div>
                    <div class="bullet"><strong>Know where your stuff is. </strong> The most annoying thing is being wet & cold and then struggling to find the XYZ thing you need. Know where your stuff is! If you're travelling with panniers, consider putting a waterproof sticker one one of them so you can tell them apart haha!</div>

                        <div class="bullet"><strong>A better understanding of bike maintenance.</strong> I could only fix a flat and tighten / unscrew a few things. I didn’t run into serious issues other than my hydraulic brakes breaking (and not braking!) but I would have had much more peace of mind had I better understood a few more things </div>
                        <div class="bullet"><strong>Go on a real test ride before the trip.</strong> And/or not do 140 miles on the first day! I quickly learned that the chamois cream actually is a necessity (there was so much chafing the first few days before I finally got my hands on some), and I should definitely not be carrying all my water on my back (very quickly bought bottle cages on day 3) </div>
                        <div class="bullet"><strong>Take it slower.</strong> 100 miles a day meant about 8 hours on the bike for me. I had to go at this pace because I wanted to finish the entire trip in the amount of time I could take off work. So, this meant I didn’t take any rest days — if there was torrential downpour (and there was!), I couldn’t take a day off and avoid the rain. </div>
                        <div class="bullet"><strong>Document better.</strong> The bike video I made was pretty limited to whatever random footage I took. To be honest, I didn’t actually think I could make it to the end when the trip started, so I didn’t explicitly put effort into taking good videos bbecause I didn’t think there’d be a bike video afterwards. Once I hit Florida, I knew I would make it to the end and that’s when I actually started putting effort into documenting the trip. </div>
                        <div class="bullet"><strong>Bring a Visa or MasterCard.</strong> I had my American Express credit card and many small business do not take Amex because they charges high fees.</div>

                I highly, highly recommend this route - it's super beginner-friendly, has signage at every turn, and is mostly off-road. I hope I've provided you with some guidance, and the resources above are wonderful for trip planning. Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Happy riding!
