		The Dartmouth Apologia is a journal, blog and forum that articulates Christian perspectives in the academic community. Apologia asked me to design the front and back of its 2018 Spring issue, whose cover article revolved around Plato's Allegory of the Cave. 
		After reading the article and researching the meaning behind Plato's thought, I created a cover that portrayed the essence of the freed prisoner returning to the cave with the knowledge of the real world.

		<b>TAKEAWAYS</b>

		<p>
		I was given a lot of freedom with the cover design given the established logo/general layout that stayed consistent with previous issues. This was the first project that required research to gain a better understanding of the design challenge. I also made sure to ask many questions since I wanted this cover to accurately reflect Apologia's mission. Being informed strongly aided my design process, and I'll bring this research phase to future projects with partners.
