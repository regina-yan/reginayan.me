		<h2>Status: Launched</h2>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
		D-Planner is an online course planner and advisor for Dartmouth students. Students needed a platform to discover courses, plan their complex and unique D-Plan schedules, and ensure they fulfill all major and distributive requirements. I worked as the designer on this project along with my team of student developers and project managers over the course of 10 weeks in Winter 2019.
		</p>
		<h2>Discovery Phase and User Research</h2>
		<p>
			Before D-Planner, students used various different resources to plan their schedules. They would search for courses through Dartmouth's ORC, then visit specific department pages to check major/minor requirements as well as terms/periods classes were offered. Students would also consult LayupList for information about medians and course reviews, and they would talk to upperclassmen about professor advice. In the first phase of this project, I researched Dartmouth's existing resources and other universities' student planner applications.   
		</p>
		<p>
			-insert layuplist screenshot, darthub/orc and example that we researched
		</p>
		<p>
			User research involved speaking to twenty students across all class years to find out their needs in a course planner website and what they currently do to manage their academic tracks. I found that most students consolidate all their information on excel spreadsheets. Students also frequently switched their on/off and abroad terms (something unique to Dartmouth's 10-week term system) and thus often had 10 different iterations of D-Plan schedules. Students also placed heavy weight on professors, medians, and peer reviews in choosing their courses.

		<h2>Sketches and Wireframing</h2>

		</div>
		<p>
		After initial research and interviews and pivoting through a few different ideas, <mark>my team decided to build a site that would give foodies insider access to the hottest food trends and where to find them. Our users wanted a sleek user flow that would take the work out of finding these trends and restaurants.</mark> So, we created "the dish."
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>User Testing</h2>	
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/landing.png" style= "width:60%;">
			<p class="subtitle">Initial landing page for the dish.</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			The first step, after deciding our key features for our MVP, was to create a "Coming Soon" landing page to drive traffic. I coded up the front-end of the landing page in HTML/CSS which features our brand, social media links, and a mini entry submission form to measure user engagement. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We also launched social media campaigns and generated a user base through our Facebook and Instagram accounts. 
		</p>
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/insta.png" style= "width:80%;">
			<p class="subtitle">We used Instagram to engage with users and build a relationship with trendy restaurants in the area.</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>High Fidelity Mockups and Iterations</h2>	
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/cariterate.png" style= "width:60%;">
			<p class="subtitle">A humbling lesson on building a product that will get better and better with each iteration</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		In the meantime, I worked on wireframing the MVP site on paper and with Balsamiq. We were inspired by this cartoon that helped us decide that a simple (but working) prototype should be our priority, rather than trying to implement every single feature from the get-go. 
		</p>
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/wireframin.png" style= "width:100%;">
			<p class="subtitle">Initial wireframing focused on 3 main pages: the landing/home page, the trend page, and the restaurant page</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>Final Designs and Website Development</h2>	
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/hifi.png" style= "width:100%;">
			<p class="subtitle">Desktop and mobile high-fidelity mockups of the 3 main pages</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		Next, I designed the high-fidelity mockups for our site with Sketch and created a prototype to bring to users for initial user testing. I had many takeaways from the testing, such as changing the menu bar location and rethinking the “Hype Factor” feature that measures user engagement/makes the site seem like it’s being used. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I also created a Style Guide to help our engineers as they coded the MVP with React.
		</p>
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/styleguide.png" style= "width:80%;">
			<p class="subtitle">Snippet of the style guide</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Technigala</h2>	
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/dabeach.png" style= "width:80%;">
			<p class="subtitle">Does this count as work?</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		With these new changes and a week of implementation (and fun at the beach), we were ready to launch our MVP!
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>Reflections</h2>	
		<div class="proj_img">
			<img src="../assets/abtest.png" style= "width:100%;">
			<p class="subtitle">We created this A/B test to see whether users engaged more with illustration icons or photo images</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		This project pushed me as a designer especially in the wireframing and user testing phase by thinking about how to incorporate a lot of data while still making the site easy to navigate for students. I've also started to better understand design trends (it seems like gradients are so popular now with many sites like Hulu abandoning its solid-green color scheme for heavy white space + gradient visuals). Overall I think this term has resulted in some of my best work, and that would not have been possible without the fantastic feedback and constructive criticism from users and my teammates.
