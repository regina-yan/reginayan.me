		<h2>Status: Completed app, awaiting launch</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
		KAF, or King Arthur Flour, is a popular cafe in Dartmouth's Baker Berry library. It is overwhelmingly popular, especially between class periods with 20-minute wait times, that “long KAF line” has become a prevalent campus meme. 
		</p>
		<p>
		During my Sophomore Summer, I worked on a team with two graduate students who proposed "Line @ KAF", an app that would use video technology to visualize the current line length and predicted upcoming line lengths. Before designing, I interviewed students on campus to figure out what features were highest in demand for the app. As expected, most complained about the line length and the <b>inability to figure out how long the line was without going there in person</b> (or texting friends who were already there). From these interviews, I also found that students were frustrated when they realized <b>the food they wanted was sold out after waiting for a long time</b> (the line blocks the view of the display window, so it's hard to see what's still available). Many also noted that <b>the menu was difficult to read</b>, as it was placed at the front of the line with very small text. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I took these insights into account when figuring out the most important features that this app needed to have. I worked mostly on the illustration and UX side while the other designer on the team focused on the wireframes. 
		</p>

		<h2>Takeaways</h2>
		<p>
		This was my first break into UI/UX design, and while I focused more on the UI side, I started understanding the process of wireframing and prototyping interfaces. This project is in the process of deployment, and the beta version will be out by Fall 2018, woohoo!
