		Below are some samples (with permission) of my work as a Brand Marketing Intern for the Recruitment team at EF Education First. I designed external campaign material, from flyers and slide decks (shown below) to email/web campaigns used during college career fairs. The main goal for these pieces was to reflect EF's brand and encourage candidates to apply!
​		</p>
		<p>
		I also worked on some internal projects such as 401(k) and Beneficiary campaigns which had a more free-form "fun" aspect and did not have to adhere to the EF brand. 
​		</p>
		<p>
		Finally, I was able to drive my own projects, which included an on-boarding booklet and the creation of an "Intern" people book that featured the "EF stories" of full-time employees who previously interned at the company. I conducted interviews, captured personalities through photos, wrote engaging copy, and designed the booklet that will be distributed to thousands of students as a marketing tool for recruitment.
​		</p>
		<p>
		Note: While I created all the illustrations and designs, I did not take the photos for the recruitment material.

		<p><b>Recruitment and Brand Marketing Guide (internal)</b></p>
		<p>I found that this job was very flexible with a lot of freedom. However, the expectations felt vague at times, so I wrote, designed, printed, and bound this pamphlet that serves as an on-boarding guide for the next intern in this position.</p>
