		This is quite meta and by no means a sly "humble-brag/undercover self-call" on my part. I thought I'd just document a bit of my process of creating this site since I figured it's about time I learn HTML/CSS/Javascript. I've found that, as a UI/UX designer working with front-end developers, it's so important to understand the engineering side so that I can 1. be more mindful of their process when I'm creating designs and 2. better communicate my ideas to them. 
		</p>
		<p>
		So, I watched a few youtube videos and played around with some online tutorials to create this site over my junior summer. I wrote basic HTML/CSS and included a bit of Javascript for the Design Thinking page. Once I had a general template, I wrote out documentation and description for the projects I’ve designed. The hardest part honestly was getting myself to stop - I would start coding/writing after dinner and suddenly realize that it's 3AM!

		I am starting to delve deeper into the UI/UX field, and I'm so excited to explore even more. I've spoken with a few web engineers during my internship at Cogo Labs to ask for feedback and advice on moving forward. I will be learning React next and working more closely with developers… we'll see what happens!
