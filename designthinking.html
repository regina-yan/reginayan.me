	<p>I took a design thinking class my junior year where I learned and put design thinking methodology into practice, from user reserearch to prototyping. Here are some samples of the work I created.</p>

	<p>TIMELINE: 2 days</p>
	<p>SKILLS: Lateral Thinking</p>
	<p> In our first assignment, we were tasked with creating patterns out of black squares. The only rules were 1) you have to make four identical pieces, and 2) the result must preserve the "essence" of a square.</p>
	<p>I started out rather simplistic, with the square cut into four squares (a horizontal and vertical cut) or four triangles (two diagonal cuts). Realizing that this was essentially an assignment in creating tesselations opened up new possibilities. As I continued on, I realized that we didn't have to use every bit of the paper - I just assumed we had to - and these insights continued to push the evolution of my squares. </p>
	<p><b>TAKEAWAY:</b> Looking at things from different approaches can result in some cool "aha" moments - going forwards, I'll make sure to <b>question my assumptions</b> and <b>find creative ways to think about the task</b> rather than accepting the obvious as the only answer. You never know what might come out of seeing things in a new and unusual light!</p>

	<p>TIMELINE: 1 week</p>
	<p>SKILLS: Reframing, Photoshop</p>
	<p>Memes are images, video, text, etc. representing behaviors or values that are prevalent in our society. For this assignment, we chose one meme that bothered us and reframed the meme to encourage a shift in mindset.</p>
	<p>
		I reframed the meme F.O.G.A., or the "Fear of Going Alone". It's something I see everywhere, especially with millenials - we are scared of (being seen) doing things alone because it's "not cool" - too many times my friends will eat dinner in their rooms because they couldn't find someone to grab a meal with, or they won't attend an event that interests them because they did not want to go by themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		This past winter, I was interning in Boston and was all alone for three months. Sure I had some contacts in the city, but with everyone's busy schedules, I often found myself on my own... and I had an absolute blast. I explored the city, attended public events, signed up for classes, and learned so much about myself as a person. These experiences provide the inspiration for this series of posters where I photoshopped myself into various situations I encountered where F.O.G.A. can occur.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not saying you should do everything alone - it's great to hang out with friends! But what I am saying is that you shouldn't be afraid when you are alone. Take those moments as opportunities to cherish the peaceful quietness, to fully be yourself and do whatever you want whenever you want, and to realize that <em>hey, you make great company.</em>
	</p>
	<p><b>TAKEAWAY:</b>I really enjoyed digging into my own thoughts in the process of creating these posters. In a meta way, this project helped me realize a lot about myself and why I cut back on social media... I guess I could create a series about F.O.M.O, the "Fear of Missing Out" as well! But overall, this project showed me <b>the power of reframing ideas</b>. In class, we saw many examples of change occuring just because someone explained or displayed things a new way, and that makes all the difference.</p>

	<p>TIMELINE: 1 week</p>
	<p>SKILLS: Observational Research, Needfinding, Prototyping, Iteration</p>
	<p> For this project, we were tasked with creating a device to help Dartmouth students better manage the things they need to carry with them. I worked in a group of three, and each of us observed our potential users for three hours to have a general idea of students' needs.</p>
	<p>We assembled our insights and ideas, and found the issue of students dropping items in class due to lack of desk space (often no desk space at all) to be a common and compelling problem. One student in particular, NAME, had to juggle a laptop, assignments, notebook, water bottle and pens all on a tiny swing-out board near her seat, and she never got through class without items rolling off. </p>
	<p>From our point of view, we decided to create a laptop case with a slide-out table and pockets to include other materials. Below are photos of our foamcore prototype.</p>
	<p>After receiving feedback, we added and improved features and laser-cut the looks-like prototype</p>
	<p><b>TAKEAWAY:</b> This was the first project where we had a user. I learned that <b>including the user throughout the process</b> is key to creating a product that he or she will actually use. Many features of our final prototype would not have existed without the input and feedback from users testing the product. For example, we added the paper holder on the bottom after realizing that our user still had to stuff papers into her backpack at she was running out of class.</p>

	<p><b>TAKEAWAY:</b> I had an absolute blast with this project. I really loved creating the prototype and filming/editing the footage (and learning how to user After Effects in the process). The real takeaway, however, came with nailing the need and the "so what" aspect of the project. My group became so caught up in the futuristic aspect of the project that we lost track of why we were creating something in the first place. By <b>refining our need</b>, we were able to turn this project from something that looked cool to something that mattered.</p>
